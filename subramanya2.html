                <p><strong>Temple Name:</strong> Sri Valli Devasena Sametha Sri Subramanyeswara Swamy Temple</p>
                <p><strong>History:</strong> The temple was constructed by the Chola rulers of the 10th and 11th Centuries. The “Vasantala Mandapam” here is a shining example of sculpture of  exllence. The “Vasantala Mandapam” is strikingly sculpted in the form of a chariot drawn by a pair of horses. The 64 pillars of the Vasantha Mandapam are tastefully decorated with pictures pf creepers and tales from Ramayanam, Bharatham and Bhagavatam.</p>
